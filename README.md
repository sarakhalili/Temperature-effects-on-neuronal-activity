# Temperature-effects-on-neuronal-activity
Temperature oscillations can affect neurological processes at various levels, with the overall outcome that higher temperatures in general increase neuronal activity [1]. While deviations in firing rates can happen while the neuronal system sustains its homeostatic firing pattern of tonic firing or bursting, changes in firing rates can also be associated with transitions between the two firing patterns [1]. In [1], Burek et al. suggested a possible mechanism directly related to the shortening of the duration of the action potential for higher firing rates with temperature rise. Increased temperatures also shrink the period-doubling cascade and chaos transition between tonic and bursting regimes [1]. 
## How to run
In this code, we implemented temperature effects on neural activity on a huber_braun model according to [1]. 

The huber_braun model is defined in "system". 

The time series of neural activity can be seen in "realtime".


Other plots can be found in "freqVSgsd" , "freqVSgsr" and "gsdVSgsr" codes.
